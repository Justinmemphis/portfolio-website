I've been using AI since 2023 (maybe even 2022 - not sure on that).  At first it seemed like an advanced Google search.  Now it seems like something different.

I have used ChatGPT 4o for a while and then I switched recently to Claude 3.7 Sonnet for code genearation and wow is it better for code generation!

But what I really wanted to talk about was the ChatGPT o3 Model.  I initially played with Deep Research and it was interesting, but o3 seems to take it to another level.  You can ask o3 very sophisticated, specific questions with broad scope and it will give you some sort of actions you could take.

For example, I used it to ask what my wife could do for different career options related to her current nursing career and it gave pretty specific answers that were very good.

I asked it about some career-related questions myself and I like the answers also.

I even asked it some therapy-sort of questions and the answers it gave there were pretty impressive.

All in all, I'm pretty sold now on the promise of AI.  I look foward to the future and what we can achieve with it.
